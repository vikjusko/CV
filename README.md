## Viktorija Jusko

A multilingual professional currently studying at Makers Academy with the intention of starting a new career as a software developer.I am an approachable individual with excellent communication skills, self-motivated and I always challenge myself to meet stretching goals. Eager to learn and build my analytical skills, problem solving and confidence in programming & code.


## Skills

Experienced in exceeding targets and leading co-worker teams. Polite and confident and all times, with a gift that develops positive internal and external relationships. I consider myself a confident negotiator, that thrives in highly pressurised, challenging environments. I am a strong team player but equally comfortable working on own initiative. I would love to be a part of a creative, ambitious and diverse company that has a strong team ethos and fosters growth to being a better developer.

#### Flexibility & Adaptability

I have studied in the UK, Latvia, France and travelled around the world, this has developed my ability to adjust to different cultures and environments.   Makers introduced different ways of working, thinking and learning that I have not necessarily experienced before, however I am throughly enjoying the process and challenge.   


#### Problem Solving & Attention to Detail

Having spent over 7 years in highly pressured and competitive sales environment I have been honoured for my attention to detail and problem solving. Frequently I had to deal with many clients facing issues whilst also creating trustworthy relationship with potential customers. Not "dropping the ball" and successfully making critical decisions was my daily responsibility. Since I started learning to code I have been working on developing and improving this skill even more - writing high quality and error free code. Breaking down problems into smaller issues and connecting the dots has given me incredible satisfaction and made me approach issues from a new angle.

#### Communication

Working and studying overseas has made me an open and great communicator. My ability to adjust to different cultures has helped me build meaningful external and internal relationships. Having dealt with different clients and problematic situations while working in travel and sales industry I always stay highly alert, empathetic and objective. Being a great listener and staying sympathetic is something I pride myself to be in my personal and professional life.
